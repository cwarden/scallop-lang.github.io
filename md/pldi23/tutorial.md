## Part A: Logic Programming and Probabilistic Programming

In this part, we will go through the Scallop language and its reasoning backend.
We will start with a simple case study of Graph Algorithms.
Then, we will imagine that we are dealing with probabilistic scene graphs and
understand how to reason with probabilities.

## Part B: Connecting Scallop to Neural Networks

### Arithmetics and
