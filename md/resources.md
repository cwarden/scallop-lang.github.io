## Source Code

We are still in the process of open sourcing Scallop, which will include the
Rust core compiler, runtime, the `scli`, `sclc`, and `sclrepl` executables,
and the Python binding.
In the meantime, please download our pre-built executables and Python wheels
for your corresponding platforms.
Please contact us if your platform isn't available and we can build the artifact
for your platform.
