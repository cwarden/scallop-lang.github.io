# Lab 2 Instructions

In this lab, we will guide you through the basic Scallop Python API, called scallopy.
The lab content includes but is not limited to:
1. How to construct and execute a Scallop program in Python using Scallopy.
2. How to perform a learning task in Python through Scallopy.

We will mainly tackle the MNIST digit recognition task during this lab:

Please download and extract [lab2.ipynb](/ssft22/labs/lab2.ipynb), and follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Jupyter Notebook with VSCode (Optional)

The Jupyter Notebook is a web application for interactive python documents.
We will demo how to use the Jupyter Notebook with VSCode here.

Step 1. Select the Python kernel for the Jupyter Notebook.

Step 2. Choose the `scallop-env` in the panel.

</div>

Step 3. You can run the code blocks by clicking on the run button, or `shift` + `return`.

## Troubleshooting
1. If you cannot find the `scallop-env` when you select the kernel for your Jupyter Notebook, you can try to restart your Visual Studio Code.
