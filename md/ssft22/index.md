# Scallop @SSFT22

Welcome! You have arrived at the main webpage for a mini-course on neurosymbolic programming in Scallop, to be presented at [SSFT22](https://fm.csl.sri.com/SSFT22/), the 11th Summer School on Formal Techniques.

This course is intended for an audience with a strong background in computer science encompassing:
1) foundations (mathematical logic and basic probability theory),
2) programming (Python or other similar language), and
3) systems (common software tools and frameworks like Docker).

The course introduces various features of the Scallop language, describes the powerful provenance-based framework of the Scallop engine, and shows how to build neurosymbolic programs with Scallop and PyTorch.

The course contains 4 lectures and 2 labs (Lab 1 and Lab 2).
The first lab covers basic exercises corresponding to the first two lectures, and the second lab
covers more advanced exercises corresponding to the last two lectures.
Before embarking on the labs, setup Scallop on your computer by completing [Lab 0](/ssft22/lab0.html).
