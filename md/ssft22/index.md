# Scallop @SSFT22

This course, provided for
[SSFT22, Eleventh Summer School on Formal Techniques](https://fm.csl.sri.com/SSFT22/),
is for the general audience to
learn the Scallop language,
understand the fundamentals of the back-end provenance module,
and lastly, be able to run simple machine learning experiments with PyTorch and Scallop.

This course contains 4 lectures and 2 labs in total.
The first lab covers practice problems for the first two lectures and the second lab
covers the last two.
Before working on the labs, please make sure to go through [Lab 0](/ssft22/lab0.html)
to get the Scallop installed and up running.
