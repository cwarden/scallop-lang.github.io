## Open Source Policy

We are still in the process of open sourcing the current Scallop project, which
will include the Rust core compiler, runtime, the `scli`, `sclc`,
and `sclrepl` executables, and the Python binding.
In the mean time, please download our pre-built executables and Python wheels
for your corresponding platforms.
Please contact us if your platform isn't available and we can build the artifact
for your platform.
